# T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis
Feb 2024 - Feb 2024Feb 2024 - Feb 2024

Description:
Built an end-to-end data analytics project focused on the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 to derive insights from match and player performance data.

ðŸ”¹ Data Collection & Preparation:
Collected match-wise and player-wise data from online sources and cricket datasets. Cleaned and structured the data using Pandas and Power Query, including converting timestamps, calculating derived metrics, and resolving inconsistencies in team/player names.

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed EDA using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover key trends such as top-performing players, team win rates, batting/bowling averages, and match outcomes based on toss decisions and first innings scores.

ðŸ”¹ Insights & Visualizations:
Created visual stories to compare team performances, highlight standout players, and analyze match dynamics. Visualized insights using bar charts, heatmaps, line plots, and custom dashboards to simplify understanding of the tournament data.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
The project showcases my ability to translate raw sports data into meaningful insights â€” combining statistical techniques and visual storytelling to analyze real-world events.
